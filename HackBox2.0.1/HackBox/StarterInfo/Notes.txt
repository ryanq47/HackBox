Add scripts module - done and all fixed

add version #s to each tool

release as 1.2\

put release notes

fix file path pyhton in scriptruynenr and .ps1 on powershell - fixed

add keylogger - keylogger added



1.3: 
- make start splash be random, throw all of them in a py file? maybe make this a 1.3 release
 also make a -q for quiet open (have a front end file named hackboxquiet.py that opens it without the splash)
- add refresh per tool

- EXE option?
